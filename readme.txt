Allow clients and customers to book appointments with you directly on your Wordpress website. Scheduling, Availability and Calendar are all easily managed from your GreatAt account.

== Description ==
Appointment Booking by GreatAt gives your customers and clients a simple way to schedule their appointment with you - all without ever leaving your Wordpress website.

Clients simply choose an available day and time, then pay you directly to secure their booking. 'Free' appointments may also be offered for scenarios such as first-time consultations or introductory offers.

You can easily set your availability, review your calendar or modify your schedule from the GreatAt app.

GreatAt's Scheduling and Calendar features ensure that you'll never miss an appointment or get double-booked. Reminders are always sent to both you and your clients. 

You can even set the amount of time you'll need in-between appointments to account for things like driving time or other preparations.

With GreatAt, you're quickly able to list the services you'd like to offer, add an appointment length, and set your price. GreatAt does the rest.

With additional features that include built-in payments, tips, ratings, reviews and chat, GreatAt is the only app that works as hard as you do.

Easily activate the Appointments & Booking widget on your Wordpress site today. Signing up is Free.
